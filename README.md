PlaNS - Planetary Navigation and Sensor System

Video Transscript:

Hi, we are team PlaNS.
We worked on the Planetary Navigation and Sensor System.

There are no GPS satellites around Mars, so rovers, sensors and even astronauts require a different technology to be able to acquire their position on the Mars surface.

Our PlaNS will solve this problem with a ground based positioning system. 
During normal data transmission from the sensor on the rover, or inside the Astronauts space suits, the PlaNS connects to it and constantly tracks the rover and determines its position inside the habitat.

So the rover can get lost in a crater and losing connection to the habitat, but the last location
 is known, so the rover can be recovered and also no Astronaut like Mark Watney will be left
 on Mars again.

Nothing and no one will be left behind on any planet with our PlaNS, even today.
